\begin{abstract}
    CAPTCHA is an acronym for the "Completely Automated Public Turing test
    to tell Computers and Humans Apart". It is a mechanism which is used to
    distinguish real human users from bots. CAPTCHAs come in a variety of forms,
    including the deciphering of obfuscated text, transcribing of audio messages,
    tracking mouse movement, and more. This research will focus on automating the
    process of deciphering text-based CAPTCHAs using machine learning
    techniques. Specifically, supervised learning is used to develop
    neural networks capable of 100\% accuracy for certain datasets. The goal of
    this research is to demonstrate the weaknesses associated with text-based
    CAPTCHA mechanisms, especially with the prevalence of machine learning
    tools.
